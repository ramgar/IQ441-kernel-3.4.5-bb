=head1 NAME

Area - A writer class for Excel Area charts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To create a simple Excel file with a Area chart using Spreadsheet::WriteExcel:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel;

    my $workbook  = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new( 'chart.xls' );
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    my $chart     = $workbook->add_chart( type => 'area' );

    # Configure the chart.
    $chart->add_series(
        categories => '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
        values     => '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
    );

    # Add the worksheet data the chart refers to.
    my $data = [
        [ 'Category', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ],
        [ 'Value',    1, 4, 5, 2, 1, 5 ],
    ];

    $worksheet->write( 'A1', $data );

    __END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements Area charts for L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel>. The chart object is created via the Workbook C<add_chart()> method:

    my $chart = $workbook->add_chart( type => 'area' );

Once the object is created it can be configured via the following methods that are common to all chart classes:

    $chart->add_series();
    $chart->set_x_axis();
    $chart->set_y_axis();
    $chart->set_title();

These methods are explained in detail in L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Chart>. Class specific methods or settings, if any, are explained below.

=head1 Area Chart Methods

There aren't currently any area chart specific methods. See the TODO section of L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Chart>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Here is a complete example that demonstrates most of the available features when creating a chart.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel;

    my $workbook  = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new( 'chart_area.xls' );
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();
    my $bold      = $workbook->add_format( bold => 1 );

    # Add the worksheet data that the charts will refer to.
    my $headings = [ 'Number', 'Sample 1', 'Sample 2' ];
    my $data = [
        [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ],
        [ 1, 4, 5, 2, 1, 5 ],
        [ 3, 6, 7, 5, 4, 3 ],
    ];

    $worksheet->write( 'A1', $headings, $bold );
    $worksheet->write( 'A2', $data );

    # Create a new chart object. In this case an embedded chart.
    my $chart = $workbook->add_chart( type => 'area', embedded => 1 );

    # Configure the first series. (Sample 1)
    $chart->add_series(
        name       => 'Sample 1',
        categories => '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
        values     => '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
    );

    # Configure the second series. (Sample 2)
    $chart->add_series(
        name       => 'Sample 2',
        categories => '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
        values     => '=Sheet1!$C$2:$C$7',
    );

    # Add a chart title and some axis labels.
    $chart->set_title ( name => 'Results of sample analysis' );
    $chart->set_x_axis( name => 'Test number' );
    $chart->set_y_axis( name => 'Sample length (cm)' );

    # Insert the chart into the worksheet (with an offset).
    $worksheet->insert_chart( 'D2', $chart, 25, 10 );

    __END__
